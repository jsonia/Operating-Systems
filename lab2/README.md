# You Spin Me Round Robin

This code implements the Round Robin Algorithm to schedule processes.

## Building

`make` We use make command to build the program

## Running
`./rr processes.txt 5` this command runs the round robin with 5 quantum length
The above command should give the following output-
`Average waiting time: 5.50`
`Average response time: 3.25`


## Cleaning up

`make clean` Cleans up all the binary files
